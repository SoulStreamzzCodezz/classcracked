***NOTE THAT CLASSCRACKED IS STILL YOUNG AND EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT***

ClassCracked was a project of mine when I recently started to learn basic HTMl and coding in general.
this project originally started on https://neocities.org. I simply brought over everything from neocities! 
ClassCracked was made to make a center for unblocked games for everyone! Not just for me and my school but anyone who can get their hands on this.
NOTE: I did not make this for people to abuse this and use during classes. Any actions of such I do not condone, and I will not be held
responsible for any incidents involving playing games during class. Note these games are blocked for a reason. They might be a good reason but their still
blocked. This site has three main links. firstly is this one on github "https://soulstreamzzcodezz.github.io/classcracked/" the  original one was made on neocities at "https://classcracked.neocities.org"
Lastly the neocities one was imported to wix and made interactive with wix buttons. This one is at "https://konradsmathsesh.wixsite.com/classcracked/"
